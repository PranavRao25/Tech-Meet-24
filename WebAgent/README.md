### basic implementation of web agent. It is not complete but you can run it. It is not complete in the sense that I didn't call the llms with .pathway but just modules. To test the gemini model, replace the hastags with with second letter in my name. And for Google search, replace the hastags with the third letter in my name(all small). The decision making of agents is little non-standard one (because it's better to not use open api key for implementing this). The code is highly inspired by [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) and [Co-Storm](https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm)
