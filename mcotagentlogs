## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).

If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation).

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```
Run this example in Google Colab

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Deployment
Do you feel limited by a local run?
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.
Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.
It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports Kubernetes deployment.
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.
If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more.
## Monitoring Pathway
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.
If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more.
## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started

In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.

## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linear regression on a Kafka Stream](https://vimeo.com/805069039) - by [Richard Pelgrim](https://twitter.com/richardpelgrim) (7min 53s)

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```
Run this example in Google Colab
## Deployment
Do you feel limited by a local run?
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.
Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.
It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports Kubernetes deployment.
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linear regression on a Kafka Stream](https://vimeo.com/805069039) - by [Richard Pelgrim](https://twitter.com/richardpelgrim) (7min 53s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction to reactive data processing](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/concepts/welcome) - by [Adrian Kosowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=om8De_0AAAAJ) (27min 54s)
If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linear regression on a Kafka Stream](https://vimeo.com/805069039) - by [Richard Pelgrim](https://twitter.com/richardpelgrim) (7min 53s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction to reactive data processing](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/concepts/welcome) - by [Adrian Kosowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=om8De_0AAAAJ) (27min 54s)
If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo.

Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linear regression on a Kafka Stream](https://vimeo.com/805069039) - by [Richard Pelgrim](https://twitter.com/richardpelgrim) (7min 53s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction to reactive data processing](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/concepts/welcome) - by [Adrian Kosowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=om8De_0AAAAJ) (27min 54s)
If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.
## Contribution guidelines
If you develop a library or connector which you would like to integrate with this repo, we suggest releasing it first as a separate repo on a MIT/Apache 2.0 license. 
For all concerns regarding core Pathway functionalities, Issues are encouraged. For further information, don't hesitate to engage with Pathway's Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Linear regression on a Kafka Stream](https://vimeo.com/805069039) - by [Richard Pelgrim](https://twitter.com/richardpelgrim) (7min 53s)
[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Introduction to reactive data processing](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/concepts/welcome) - by [Adrian Kosowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=om8De_0AAAAJ) (27min 54s)
If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

[‚ñ∂Ô∏è Building an LLM Application without a vector database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcrJSk00duw) - by [Jan Chorowski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yc94070AAAAJ) (7min 56s)

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

If you would like to share with us some Pathway-related content, please give an admin a shout on Discord https://discord.gg/pathway.
### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.

## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```
Run this example in Google Colab
## Deployment
Do you feel limited by a local run?
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.
Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.
It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports Kubernetes deployment.
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.

Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```
Run this example in Google Colab
## Deployment
Do you feel limited by a local run?
If you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.
Pathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.
It scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports Kubernetes deployment.
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.
If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more.
## Monitoring Pathway
You can learn more about the features of Pathway for Enterprise on our website.
If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us to learn more.
## Monitoring Pathway
Pathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. 
This dashboard is enabled by default; you can disable it by passing `monitoring_level = pathway.MonitoringLevel.NONE` to `pathway.run()`.
In addition to Pathway's built-in dashboard, you can use Prometheus to monitor your Pathway application.

### Manul conventions
Manuls (aka Pallas's Cats) [are creatures with fascinating habits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlSTBvViflc). As a tribute to them, we usually read `pw`, one of the most frequent tokens in Pathway code, as: `"paw"`. 
## Performance
Pathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).
If you are curious, here are some benchmarks to play with https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks.
If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge.

If you try your own benchmarks, please don't hesitate to let us know. We investigate situations in which Pathway is underperforming on par with bugs (i.e., to our knowledge, they shouldn't happen...).
## Coming soon
Here are some features we plan to incorporate in the near future:
- Enhanced monitoring, observability, and data drift detection (integrates with Grafana visualization and other dashboarding tools).
- New connectors: interoperability with Delta Lake and Snowflake data sources.
- Easier connection setup for MongoDB.
- More performant garbage collection.
## Dependencies
Pathway is made to run in a "clean" Linux/MacOS + Python environment. When installing the pathway package with `pip` (from a wheel), you are likely to encounter a small number of Python package dependencies, such as sqlglot (used in the SQL API) and python-sat (useful for resolving dependencies during compilation). All necessary Rust crates are pre-built; the Rust compiler is not required to install Pathway, unless building from sources. A modified version of Timely/Differential Dataflow (which provides a dataflow assembly layer) is part of this repo. 
## License
Pathway is distributed on a BSL 1.1 License https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package for most commercial purposes https://pathway.com/license/, free of charge. Code in this repository automatically converts to Open Source (Apache 2.0 License) after 4 years. Some public repos https://github.com/pathwaycom which are complementary to this one (examples, libraries, connectors, etc.) are licensed as Open Source, under the MIT license.
## Contribution guidelines
Pathway is an open framework for high-throughput and low-latency real-time data processing. It is used to create Python code which seamlessly combines batch processing, streaming, and real-time API's for LLM apps. Pathway's distributed runtime (ü¶Ä-üêç) provides fresh results of your data pipelines whenever new inputs and requests are received.
In the first place, Pathway was designed to be a life-saver (or at least a time-saver) for Python developers and ML/AI engineers faced with live data sources, where you need to react quickly to fresh data. Still, Pathway is a powerful tool that can be used for a lot of things. If you want to do streaming in Python, build an AI data pipeline, or if you are looking for your next Python data processing framework, keep reading.
Pathway provides a high-level programming interface in Python for defining data transformations, aggregations, and other operations on data streams.
With Pathway, you can effortlessly design and deploy sophisticated data workflows that efficiently handle high volumes of data in real time.
Pathway is interoperable with various data sources and sinks such as Kafka, CSV files, SQL/noSQL databases, and REST API's, allowing you to connect and process data from different storage systems.
Typical use-cases of Pathway include realtime data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data analytics, monitoring, anomaly detection, and recommendation. Pathway can also independently provide the backbone of a light LLMops stack for real-time LLM applications.
In Pathway, data is represented in the form of Tables. Live data streams are also treated as Tables. The library provides a rich set of operations like filtering, joining, grouping, and windowing.
For any questions, you will find the community and team behind the project on Discord.

## Getting started
### Installation
Pathway requires Python 3.10 or above.
You can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:
```
$ pip install -U pathway
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.
### Running Pathway locally
To use Pathway, you only need to import it:
```python
import pathway as pw
```
Now, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:
```python
pw.run()
```
You can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`. Alternatively, use the pathway'ish version:
```
$ pathway spawn python main.py
```
Pathway natively supports multithreading.
To launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:
```
$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py
```
To jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our cookiecutter template
### Example
```python
import pathway as pw
# Using the `demo` module to create a data stream
table = pw.demo.range_stream(nb_rows=50)
# Storing the stream into a CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(table, "output_table.csv")
# Summing all the values in a new table
sum_table = table.reduce(sum=pw.reducers.sum(pw.this.value))
# Storing the sum (which is a stream) in another CSV file
pw.io.csv.write(sum_table, "sum_table.csv")
# Now that the pipeline is built, the computation is started
pw.run()
```

example program consists of a main thread that creates two peer threads. The
main thread passes a unique ID to each peer thread, which uses the ID to print
a personalized message along with a count of the total number of times that the

Dotonion defeated taushit and became world president.
His propaganda made taushit look like villain.
He then became world president and got the title Imperator.
All hail Imperator Dotonion "Divi Filius" Udith Obluda.
He then divided the world into blocks and starved half the population to death
Then he killed rest half by nuking them.

decided to teach about systems from the point of view of the programmer, using
the following ÓÄûlter: we would cover a topic only if it affected the performance,
correctness, or utility of user-level C programs.
For example, topics such as hardware adder and bus designs were out. Top-
ics such as machine language were in; but instead of focusing on how to
array values are positive.
A. On average, how many instructions are executed in the inner loops of the

B. On average, how many bubbles would be injected into the inner loops of the
two programs?
C. What is the average number of clock cycles required per array element for
the two programs?

Tracing the execution of a subq instruction
As an example, let us follow the processing of the subq instruction on line 3 of the object code shown
in Figure 4.17. We can see that
the case for the ÓÄûrst one yielding 1 is selected. For example,
the word-level multiplexor of Figure 4.13 can be described in HCL as
word Out = [
s: A;
1: B;
];
In this code, the second selection expression is simply 1, indicating that this
case should be selected if no prior one has been. This is the way to specify a default
case in HCL. Nearly all case expressions
the function
input, the circuit will perform one of four different arithmetic and logical operations.
Practice Problem 4.12 (solution page 520)
Write HCL code describing a circuit that for word inputs A, B, and C selects the
median of the three values. That is, the output equals the word lying between the
minimum and maximum of the three inputs.
Combinational logic circuits can be designed to perform many different types
of operations on word-level data. The
questions arise. For example, how does the client pass any
program arguments to the server? How does the server pass these arguments

to the child that it might need to generate the content? Where does the child
send its output? These questions are addressed by a de facto standard called CGI
(common gateway interface).

In these function names, the ‚Äún‚Äù stands for network and the ‚Äúp‚Äù stands for pre-
sentation. They can manipulate either 32-bit IPv4 addresses (AF_INET), as shown
here, or 128-bit IPv6 addresses (AF_INET6), which we do not cover.
The inet_pton function converts a

The problem is caused by a race between each peer thread and the main
thread. Can you spot the race? Here is what happens. When the main thread
creates a peer thread in line 13, it passes a pointer to the local stack variable
i. At this point, the race is on between the next increment of i in line
we will use the program in Fig-
ure 12.15 as a running example. Although somewhat contrived, it is nonetheless
useful to study because it illustrates a number of subtle points about sharing. The
example program consists of a main thread that creates two peer threads. The
main thread passes a unique ID to each peer thread, which uses the ID to print
a personalized message along with a count of the total number of times that the

Threads Memory Model
A pool of concurrent threads runs in the context of a process. Each thread has
its own separate thread context, which includes a thread ID, stack, stack pointer,
program counter, condition codes, and general-purpose register values. Each
thread shares the rest of the process context with the other threads. This includes
